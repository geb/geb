=== 0.9.1

==== Breaking changes

* Passing a page with no at checker to `click(List&lt;Class&lt;? extends Page&gt;&gt;)` or as one of the pages in `to` template option will throw `UndefinedAtCheckerException`.

=== 0.9.0

==== New features

* New `via()` method that behaves the same way as `to()` behaved previously - it sets the page on the browser and does not verify the at checker of that page[issue:249[]].
* It is now possible to provide your own `{navigator-api}` implementations by specifying a custom link:api/geb/navigator/factory/NavigatorFactory.html[`NavigatorFactory`], see <<navigator-factory, this manual section>> for more information [issue:96[]].
* New variants of `withFrame()` method that allow to switch into frame context and change the page in one go and also automatically change it back to the original page after the call, see [switching pages and frames at once][switch-frame-and-page] in the manual [issue:213[]].
* `wait`, `page` and `close` options can be passed to `withNewWindow()` calls, see <<newly-opened-windows, this manual section>> for more information [issue:167[]].
* Improved message of UnresolvablePropertyException to include a hint about forgetting to import the class [issue:240[]].
* Improved signature of `Browser.at()` and `Browser.to()` to return the exact type of the page that was asserted to be at / was navigated to.
* link:api/geb/report/ReportingListener.html[`ReportingListener`] objects can be registered to observe reporting (see: <<listening-to-reporting, this manual section>>)

==== Fixes

* Fixed an issue where waitFor would throw a WaitTimeoutException even if the last evaluation before timeout returned a truthy value [issue:215[]].
* Fixed taking screenshots for reporting when the browser is not on a HTML page (e.g. XML file) [issue:126[]].
* Return the last evaluation value for a `(wait: true, required: false)` content instead of always returning null [issue:216[]].
* `isAt()` behaves the same as `at()` in regards to updating the browser's page instance to the given page type if its at checker is successful [issue:227[]].
* Handling of `select` elements has been reworked to be far more efficient [issue:229[]].
* Modules support accessing base attributes' values using @attributeName notation [issue:237[]].
* Use of text matchers in module base definitions is supported [issue:241[]].
* Reading of textareas have been updated so that the current value of the text field is returned, instead of the initial [issue:174[]].

==== Breaking changes

* `to(Class&lt;? extends Page&gt;)` method now changes the page on the browser and verifies the at checker of that page in one method call [issue:1[]], [issue:249[]]; use `via()` if you need the old behaviour
* `getAttribute(String)` on `Navigator` now returns `null` for boolean attributes that are not present.
* `at()` and `to()` methods on `Browser` now return a page instance if they succeed and `via()` method always returns a page instance [issue:217[]].
* `withFrame()` calls that don't take a page argument now change the browser page to what it was before the call, after the call [issue:222[]].
* due to performance improvements duplicate elements are not removed when creating new `Navigator`s anymore; the new `unique()` method on `Navigator` can be used to remove duplicates if needed [issue:223[]].
* `at(Page)` and `isAt(Page)` methods on `Browser` have been removed as they were inconsistent with the rest of the API [issue:242[]].
* Navigator's `click(Class&lt;? extends Page&gt;)` and `to:` content option now verify page after switching to the new one to stay consistent with the new behaviour of `to(Class&lt;? extends Page&gt;)` [issue:250[]].
* Reading an attribute that is not set on a navigator now returns an empty string across all drivers [issue:251[]].

=== 0.7.2

==== Fixes

=== 0.7.1

==== New features

* Geb is now built with Groovy 1.8.6. This was forced to resolve [issue:194[]].

* Form control shortcuts now also work on page and module content
* Custom timeout message for `waitFor()` calls
* Navigators can be composed also from content
* Closure expressions passed to `waitFor()` calls are now transformed so that every statement in them is asserted - this provides better reporting on `waitFor()` timeouts.
* `at` closure properties of Page classes are now transformed so that every statement in them is asserted - this provides better reporting on failed at checks
* new `isAt()` method on Browser that behaves like `at()` used to behave before, i.e. does not throw AssertionError but returns `false` if at checking fails
* `withAlert()` and `withConfirm()` now accept a `wait` option and the possible values are the same as for waiting content

==== Breaking changes

* `click()` now instructs the browser to click *only on the first* element the navigator has matched

* The `getBaseUrl()` method from testing subclasses has been removed, use the configuration mechanism
* Inputs with no value now report their value as an empty string instead of `null`
